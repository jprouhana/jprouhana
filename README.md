### Hi, I'm John Paul

CS sophomore at Arizona State University interested in quantum computing and machine learning.

Currently exploring how variational quantum algorithms (VQE, QAOA) and quantum kernel methods can be applied to optimization and classification problems. Most of my recent work uses Qiskit to build and benchmark hybrid quantum-classical systems on simulators.

#### What I've been working on

- Comparing quantum feature map encodings and their effect on classification accuracy
- Benchmarking error mitigation strategies for noisy quantum circuits
- Investigating trainability limitations (barren plateaus) in parameterized quantum circuits
- Implementing QAOA for combinatorial optimization and VQE for molecular simulation

#### Tools I use

Python, Qiskit, NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Jupyter
